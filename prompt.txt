Implement an advanced priority arbiter with aging in sources/advanced_priority_arbiter.sv.

The arbiter must:
1. Support N requesters (default 4) with configurable class-based priorities
2. Implement a fairness mechanism (parameterized by FAIR_K) to prevent starvation
3. Handle downstream backpressure correctly using the gnt_ready signal
4. Maintain one-hot grant encoding with gnt_valid signal
5. Ensure fairness advances during backpressure (time-based, not grant-based)
6. Support active-low asynchronous reset

Key challenges:
- Balancing priority ordering with fairness guarantees
- Correctly holding grants during backpressure while fairness continues to advance
- Ensuring no requester is starved even during prolonged backpressure

See docs/Specification.md for complete interface and behavioral requirements.
