Implement a priority arbiter with aging in sources/priority_arbiter.sv.

The arbiter must:
1. Support N requesters with configurable base priorities
2. Implement effective priority aging to prevent starvation
3. Reset effective priority when a request is granted
4. Maintain priority when requests are dropped (not continuously asserted)
5. Saturate effective priority at maximum (no wrap-around)

See docs/Specification.md for complete interface and behavioral requirements.

Key challenge: Correctly implement the aging logic for continuous requests while handling grant resets and request drops.
